# Pinger

This application uses electron js to display the ping, the values for the parsed console output is hardcoded in german language, you may change these lines to your language. the interval to get a new ping is triggered every 250ms and shows the ping in a neat little box floating over your desktop.

You can use electron packager to make a exe file to your likings like 32bit/64bit versions. The code is npm start win in my case.

npm start

to package to a exe file use 

npm run win
